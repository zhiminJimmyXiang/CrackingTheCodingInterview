You are given two 32-bit numbers, N andM, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a
method to insert M into Nsuch that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume
that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all ofM. That is, ifM= 10011,
you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for
example, have j-3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
